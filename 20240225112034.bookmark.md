Neovim, along with tmux, is probably the software
I use the most on a daily basis. I use it for taking notes, configuring servers,
coding, and writing blog posts. I cannot imagine my life without it anymore.

Occasionally, when writing blog posts or documentation, I need to find synonyms.
While I could search for them online, the good news is that I can use Vim/Neovim
for this purpose.

### Thesaurus

First, a little definition. What is a thesaurus?

A thesaurus is a reference work that lists words grouped by similarity of meaning, often with definitions, antonyms and usage examples.

By default, Vim/Neovim doesn't come with a thesaurus installed.

There are plugins available to add them, but that's not what we're going to do.
I'll show you how to use a text file full of synonyms.

Here is a
[French](https://github.com/Nicoloren/vim-french-thesaurus/blob/master/francais_vim.txt),
and an [English](http://lazybear.io/thesaurus-english.txt) one, that you can
also find in the documentation (*:h compl-thesaurus*)

Those files contains lines like this:

``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:3;-o-tab-size:3;tab-size:3"}
    spy operative spectator witness viewer watcher looker descry spot espy sight 
    spyeria Spyeria
    spyglass glass
    spyhole peephole hole
    spying watch vigil intelligence detection catching espial spotting discovery 
    
```

There is nothing particularly noteworthy about those files. It is possible to add your own
words if desired.

### Configuration

If you use Vim:

-   download or create your thesaurus files
-   configure your `~/.vimrc` to use them by adding that line:

``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:3;-o-tab-size:3;tab-size:3"}
    set thesaurus += ~/.vim/thesaurus/thesaurus-english.txt # or any path you want
    set thesaurus += ~/.vim/thesaurus/thesaurus-french.txt  # if you have more than one 
    
```

That's all!

For Neovim, I have a `~/.config/nvim/lua/hyde/options.lua` with a small loop:

``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:3;-o-tab-size:3;tab-size:3"}
    -- options.lua 
    local o = vim.opt
    
    [...]

    -- thesaurus
    local thesaurusfiles = {
      "~/.config/nvim/thesaurus/thesaurus-english.txt",
      "~/.config/nvim/thesaurus/thesaurus-french.txt"
    }

    for _, path in ipairs(thesaurusfiles) do
      o.thesaurus:append(path)
    end
    
```

Let learn how to use once it has been configured.

### Usage

When using Vim/Neovim, you can access a thesaurus completion feature by typing
`Ctrl-x Ctrl-t` while in *Insert* mode. This will provide you with a list of
synonyms.

``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:3;-o-tab-size:3;tab-size:3"}
    abbey[Ctrl-x Ctrl-t]
        abbey       /home/hyde/.config/nvim/thesaurus/thesaurus-english.txt
        church      /home/hyde/.config/nvim/thesaurus/thesaurus-english.txt
        convent     /home/hyde/.config/nvim/thesaurus/thesaurus-english.txt
        monastery   /home/hyde/.config/nvim/thesaurus/thesaurus-english.txt
    
```

The only issue arises when a completion occurs on certain words, such as 'spy'.
This word is also present on different lines of the thesaurus file:

``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:3;-o-tab-size:3;tab-size:3"}
    a*spy* rough gruff hoarse husky piercing raucous strident rending ripping splitting noisy
    counterspy mole spy
    cri*spy* crisp
    descry spot e*spy* spy sight
    detection espial *spy*ing spotting discovery find uncovering contracting acquiring getting
    
```

The line completion feature searches for and suggests the following lines based
on the input. Therefore, the suggested synonyms may not be accurate.

I have raised [an issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27477),
and hope that it will be resolved soon.

I've been using a Dvorak layout for a couple of years now. I think I started around 2019, but I'm not 100% sure.
I got pretty decent with it.
